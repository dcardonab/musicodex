# MusiCodex

MusiCodex is an ongoing instructional project. My vision is for it to eventually turn into a resource that musicians and students can use to better understand the innewrokings and technologies of music production. The project implements various instructional design approaches to offer hands on experiences, as well as literature to ensure a practical and theoretical understading.

The practical examples were designed using [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max), by [Cycling '74](https://cycling74.com/). I chose Max as the development platform as it permits any user to interact with the scripts without needing to purchase a license. Additionally, licensed users have the capacity to edit and repurpose the designed scripts.

You may find the theoretical component and the corresponding Max patch in the [modules directory](https://github.com/dcardonab/musicodex/modules/). When downloading the Max patches, be sure to also download the enclosed *media* folder, so that you can experiment as soon as you open the patch. You may also load your own audio files to see how the processors affect them.

Please let me know what your thoughts are and check out more of my work in my [personal website](https://soundarchitect.herokuapp.com/).
